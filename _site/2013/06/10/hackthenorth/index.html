      <h1>Hack the North 11</h1>
    <span class="date">10 June 2013</span>

<p>As of writing this post I’ve gone approximately 36 hours without sleeping after attending my first serious hackathon, Greylock Hackfest @ Medium. As you can probably guess, I’m pretty exhausted, but I want to put everything down in writing before I forget it. I hope you’ll forgive me if I veer off topic.
By the way, I also find it kind of amusing that I’m making my first post on Medium after attending the hackathon they hosted this weekend.</p>

<h3>The Idea — HyperInk</h3>

<p>Late Thursday night, we got together to brainstorm for the hackathon. Thinking of any idea was actually pretty difficult. We knew we wanted to create something more than just your typical web application. We wanted to build something cool, something that would connect the physical world with the digital one. A rather ambitious undertaking for a 23 hour project, but as my teammate Kevin Kwok (@antimatter) would say, #YOLO.</p>

<h3>Let the Hacking Begin</h3>

<p>On the day of the hackathon, I made my way to Anish’s place at around 8:30 in the morning so Shelby could pick us up. Kevin was already in San Francisco, having partied with some Dropbox guys the night before, so we agreed to meet up at Medium HQ around 9:30 — a whole hour before the doors even officially opened. I guess we were pretty excited.</p>

<p>As expected, we were told that we were way too early when we showed up on the premises, but Julie (the awesome person from Greylock who was basically running the whole show) told us that we could get first dibs on claiming space for our team, so we were pretty excited. With an iPhone stand built from K’Nex in hand, we all crossed the street to wait at a crowded San Francisco coffee shop while passersby stared curiously at our contraption.</p>

<p>At 10:15 we promptly returned to Medium to scout out the hackerspace. We found a sweet room with a table, a couch, and a huge television screen that we staked out for ourselves, and began to chill, chat, and meet other teams while we waited for the hackathon to officially start.</p>
